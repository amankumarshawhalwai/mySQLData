TRANSACTIONS:
     Set of logically related queries executed in a particular order to complete a specific use case.
     Example: In a bank money transfer, on the payee side the account balance is checked then debited and changes are committed.
               On the receiver's side, the same process is repeated and the changes are committed.

Now, there can be multiple transactions like this that can happen. So, concurrency problems can arise.
a) Interaction between transactions can lead to wrong situations.
b) Transaction may get executed only half because of system failure.
